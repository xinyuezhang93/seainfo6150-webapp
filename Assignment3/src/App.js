            <p>The <a href = "https://www.cnn.com/2013/07/03/us/statue-of-liberty-fast-facts/index.html">Statue of Liberty'</a>s original torch is getting a new home.
            </p>
            <p>Made of copper and gold so that it would shine bright, the first torch took a beating from the weather and was replaced by a replica in 1984. It's been stored in <a href="https://www.nps.gov/stli/planyourvisit/visiting-the-pedestal.htm">the statue's pedestal</a> ever since.
            </p>
            <p>But visitors will be able to see the original 3,600-pound torch in all its glory at a new Statue of Liberty Museum, which will open on <a href="https://www.libertyellisfoundation.org/visiting-liberty-island">Liberty Island</a> in May 2019. The torch was transported there by truck last week, along with a replica model of Lady Liberty's face.
            </p>
            <p><q>"Although it is not one of the most difficult things we have ever moved,"</q> says Douglas Phelps, who oversaw the relocation of the torch, <i>"it is certainly the most important."</i>
            </p>
            <p>Not only is the Statue of Liberty the symbol of New York City, she is also a UNESCO World Heritage site under the designation of <strong>"Outstanding Universal Value."</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Her full name is Liberty Enlightening the World, and she was designed by Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel -- yes, the same guy who built Paris's Eiffel Tower.
            </p>
            <p>Lady Liberty was a gift from France to the United States to celebrate the centennial of their nation's independence -- although, somewhat awkwardly, she arrived a decade too late. Nevertheless, President Grover Cleveland formally unveiled her in 1886.
            </p>
            <p>Since then, the statue has served as a symbol of hope and possibility for many people who entered the United States as immigrants via neighboring Ellis Island.
            </p>
            <p><q>"The original torch is a beautiful object of art and exemplifies the American ideals of freedom and democracy,"</q> says John Piltzecker, superintendent of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. That symbolic spirit was bolstered by the decision to inscribe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Lazarus">Emma Lazarus</a>' poem <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Colossus">"The New Colossus"</a> on the statue's pedestal, which gave Lady Liberty one of her nicknames, "Mother of Exiles."
            </p>
            <p>The most famous lines in the poem are: <q>"Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."</q>
            </p>
            <p>In 2017, nearly <strong>4.5 million</strong> people visited Liberty Island.
            </p>
            <p>When completed, the Statue of Liberty Museum will be <strong>26,000 square feet</strong> of history, inspiration and deeper analysis of the statue's symbolism both in the US and around the world.
            </p>
            <p>The <strong>"inspiration gallery"</strong>, which is where the torch will live, will have floor-to-ceiling glass windows looking out at Lower Manhattan, including the World Trade Center.
